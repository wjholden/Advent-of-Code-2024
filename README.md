# Advent of Code 2024

Rust!

Third time's the charm. I first attempted Rust in 2021 or so but quickly realized
that this wasn't a language I could easily pick up. If you already know C++,
Java, C#, or maybe JavaScript and Go then any of those languages are pretty
learnable. Likewise, if you're already comfortable with Julia then Python should
feel pretty easy.

Rust is different. The borrow checker and match statement are like nothing I had
ever seen before. I read most of the Rust Book and also most of Rust By Example,
both of which require some effort to get through. Still, I learned the hard way
(by na√Øvely using *Mathematica* cold on AoC years ago) that it pays to read a
book first. Last year, I read *The Go Programming Language* by Donovan and
Kernighan and it was very helpful.

# Daily Themes and Stars

1. `**` programming basics: parsing input, loops, sorting...this is day 1?
2. `**` corner cases, refactoring, premature optimization, tests, $O(8) = O(1)$
3. `**` regular expressions, reading the instructions (example 2 is not the same as example 1)
4. `**` 2D arrays, bounds, regex doesn't work, graph traversal
5. `**` sorting with custom comparators
6. `**` object-oriented programming, order of operations, cycles, grids, why is this so slow?
7. `**` recursion, operator precedence, digit string concatenation, why is this so fast?
8. `**` vectors, procedural programming, [grids](https://docs.rs/grid/latest/grid/), distinct values (sets; deduplication)
9. `**` disk fragmentation, arrays (trickier-than-it-looks, annoying procedural programs, puzzle could probably be solved faster than actually doing it...)
10. `**` searching (I used BFS), grids, path-finding
11. `**` dynamic programming, recursion, automata
12. `**` more grids, divide-and-conquer was not the solution, graph searches
13. `**` linear algebra (`Ax=b`), greedy algorithms, integer division loses information
14. `**` corner case (well, "center case" since the middle doesn't count), constants, modulus operator, even more grids, find the Christmas tree
15. `**` still more grids, refactoring, procedural programming/mutable state, so many cases, order of operations, queues
16. `**` A*, pathfinding, complex arithmetic

# Lessons Learned

* VSCode helps so much when it shows the inferred types.
* Consider using `into_iter` when it's OK to consume the iterator or decorate
[closure parameters]
(https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/fn/closures/closure_examples/iter_any.html)
with `&` to make them a little more comfortable.
* Use `&[T]` instead of `Vec<T>` as [function arguments]
(https://users.rust-lang.org/t/when-does-one-use-slices-as-arguments/89499).
* `count()` might not do what you expect. Did you mean `len()`? You might need to
collect the iterator into a collection.
* `filter_map()` makes clever use of optionals to combine filter and map. It
composes nicely with `match`.
* Rust regex doesn't support lookahead (`?=`). Might have been useful for day 4.
* `Vec<Vec<char>>` sorta works for 2D strings, but it isn't as clean as you'd like.
* Rust apparently has no try/catch.
There isn't a great way to backtrack from array accesses with yolo bound checks.
I think you could avoid the panic with `get`, but this didn't work with my `Vec<Vec<_>>`.
A hashmap might have been much easier than nested vectors.
* `is_sorted_by` and `sort_by` expect different comparison functions.
`is_sorted_by` operates on booleans, `sort_by` uses `Ordering`.
* Day 6 was difficult for me. I came up with an interesting solution
([inspired by a Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1h7vpqi/comment/m0oxavw/))
based on TTLs instead of keeping the path explored. It was a case where compute
is faster than memory.
* Someone else on [Reddit helped me with an extra test case](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1h81nc0/comment/m0ppjcy/).
* `ilog` on integers is [much faster](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1h8l3z5/comment/m0vp3p7/) than 
casting to and from float types for logarithms.
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40006219/why-is-it-discouraged-to-accept-a-reference-string-vec-or-box-as-a-function
* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30633177/implement-fmtdisplay-for-vect
* Expect compiler errors or runtime crashes on integer overflow. One should
prefer addition to subtraction when comparising distance. z.B, to check if
`a: u8` is one less than `b: u8`, use `a + 1 == b` instead of `b - a == 1`.
* Day 11 was a tricky dymanic programming problem. Two tricks: you don't need to
worry about the stone order (despite the phrasing of the prompt), and you only 
need to count occurrences of the numbered stones.
* I had my head wrapped around a jagged recursive triangle, but you don't need that.
This is more like the iterative Fibonacci approach with `while i < k { (a, b) = (a + b, b); i += 1 }`.
You actually *can* use trees, but you need to count down
to a basis of `depth=1`. See [[2024 Day 11][Python] MEGA TUTORIAL](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1hbnyx1/2024_day_11python_mega_tutorial/).
See also [[2024 Day 11] Every sequence converges to 3947 points (with proof)](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/1hbtz8w/2024_day_11_every_sequence_converges_to_3947/)
for an interesting study of attractors in this problem.
* `include_str!` can bring in the contents of a file. My tests show that the
performance is about the same as `std::fs::read_to_string`,
but it's nice to ship a binary with no dependent files.
* In day 9 I had some trouble with the borrow checker. Passing a reference to a
mutable struct into a function might not work. Consider the object-oriented
approach.
* Be careful with the Copy and Clone traits with the members of a mutable array.
You might accidentally copy a value without realizing it, then be surprised
that your writes aren't working. A workaround is to just reference the array
members directly.
* Vector comparison (`v1 < v2`) might not quite do what you expect in [nalgebra](https://docs.rs/nalgebra/).
* I might have to check out [ndarray](https://crates.io/crates/ndarray).
* These procedural days (days 6, 8, 9, 12, 15) are difficult. Maybe Rust makes it worse, maybe I'm just not good at them.
* The swaps I did in day 15 probably made this harder than it needed to be.
I had made an early design decision to model the game as a grid (2D array) with contents,
rather than a collection of game objects with coordinates. Had I opted for the objects,
I could have simply incremented their x/y positions as a group instead of this order-dependent swap nightmare.
* [`flat_map`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.flat_map) combines map and flatten.
* The [`@` operator](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69435734/rust-what-does-the-at-sign-operator-do) binds matched values of a pattern to values.
* Rust's `std::collections` does not have a
[red-black tree](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/TreeMap.html), but it does provide a 
[BTree](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/btree_map/struct.BTreeMap.html).
